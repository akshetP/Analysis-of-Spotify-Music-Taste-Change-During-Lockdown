# My_Spotify_Data_Analysis
Inspired and under the guidance of [Snigdha](https://github.com/Sniggdhaa/Me-Music-and-I), an exceptionally inspiring senior I know.
After six months in lockdown and being a data science and machine learning enthusiast, I decided to take up a course on [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) and [Data Visualization using Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization) on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) . After fiishing the courses and inspired by the best, I took up the oppurtunity to look back at my streaming history to identify the changes in my music tastes during the lockdown. 
During the process I identified the following:  
### 1. I listened to 855 artists during a period of 12 months, out of which I discovered 258 of them only after the lockdown.
### 2. I streamed 15.8 days or 364.41 hours of Tracks on Spotify between Sep, 2019 - Sep, 2020.
### 3. My top 15 Tracks almost changed completely. 
### 4. My top artists and tracks changed during the lockdown.
### 5. My top two favourite artists based on the data are 'The Local Train' and 'Imagine Dragons' which is 100% accurate.
